         I am a product manager, design researcher and ux designer for civic tech projects. I'm a New Yorker living in San Francisco.
       </p>
       <p>
        In November, I completed a fellowship with Code for America where I worked as part of a three person team to <a href= "http://codeforamerica.github.io/vallejo-midyear-report/">build open source citizen engagement tools for the City of Vallejo, California</a>. Currently, I research for Code for America's health team, which is focused on <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/focus/health/">improving access to food stamps in California</a>.

        I came to Code for America after completing an M.S. in <a href= "http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/integrated-digital-media-ms">Integrated Digital Media at NYU's Engineering School</a> where I was a Women in Technology fellow and a Project Management Fellow with the <a href= "http://www.thegovlab.org">GovLab@NYU</a>.

        Before returning to graduate school, I practiced as a criminal defense attorney in New York.
        I transitioned toward technology to explore ways of improving governmental systems that I found so difficult to work within.
        Having years of experience working on nonprofit campaigns and advocating for vulnerable clients has certainly taught me invaluable skills in humility, empathy, communication, risk-management, and strategy.

        I recently moderated a panel, <a href= "https://www.codeforamerica.org/summit/schedule/#breakout_137"><i>Building Digital Tools for Legal Service Providers,</i></a> at the Code for America Summit because I am passionate about exploring ways that digital technologies can help low income individuals access justice.
        I'm always happy to chat about topics related to this with anyone who is interested.
      </p>
      I like cooking, biking, conversations, multi-media storytelling, museums and the beach.
      I also practice Ashtanga yoga. If you want me to help you with yoga postures, come by <a href= "http://missionashtanga.com">Mission Ashtanga</a> in Potrero Hill on a Sunday morning when I assist during Mysore practice.
