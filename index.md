I am a design researcher, product manager, and lawyer, currently focused on improving the experience of public services. I recently completed a four year term as a product manager at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), where I led digital transformation engagements with government agencies and developed [internally funded](https://10x.gsa.gov/) r&d projects. I was named a [Legal Rebel](https://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/nikki_zeichner_profile) by the American Bar Association in 2015 and I continue to work on problems that sit at the intersection of law, technology, and expression.
