I am a design researcher and strategist focused on improving the experience of public services and a fellow at [New America Foundation](https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/nikki-zeichner/). I recently completed a four year term as a strategist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), where I led digital transformation engagements with government agencies and most recently partnered with the GSAâ€™s privacy office to modernize how they safeguard the personal information they collect from the public.

I am both a practiciing artist and former public interest lawyer, and was named a Legal Rebel by the American Bar Association and I continue to work on problems that sit at the intersection of law, technology, and expression.
