      I design digital tools that help city governments provide better social services.
</p>
         <p>

        In November, I completed a fellowship with Code for America where I worked as part of a three person team to <a href= "http://codeforamerica.github.io/vallejo-midyear-report/">build open source citizen engagement tools for the City of Vallejo, California</a>.
        Currently, I research for Code for America's health team, which is focused on <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/focus/health/">improving access to food stamps in California</a>.
</p>
<p>
        I came to Code for America after completing an M.S. in <a href= "http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/integrated-digital-media-ms">Integrated Digital Media at NYU's Engineering School</a> where I was a Women in Technology fellow and a Project Management Fellow with the <a href= "http://www.thegovlab.org">GovLab@NYU</a>.
        Before returning to graduate school, I practiced as a criminal defense attorney in New York and developed <a href="http://museumoftheamericanprison.org">multi-media public projects about incarceration in the U.S.</a>

         Having years of experience working on nonprofit campaigns and advocating for vulnerable clients has taught me humility, empathy, listening, risk-management, and the know how to creatively get things done in challenging circumstances. I'm curious and always up for a challenge.
Regarding work, <i>who I work with</i> is just as, if not more, important than the details of the project. There's nothing like working with great people towards a goal that everyone believes in.
        </p>
      </p>
  I also practice yoga. I have been practicing <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_style">Ashtanga Yoga mysore style</a> regularly since 2004. I've had wonderful teachers along the way, but have primarily studied with <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGrGRBi0u28">Eddie Stern</a> in New York.
    Now that I am in San Francisco, I study with Devorah Sacks and <a href= "http://missionashtanga.com">Mission Ashtanga</a>. On Sunday mornings, I give posture adjustments during practice.
