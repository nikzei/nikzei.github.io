      <h1>Nikki Zeichner</h1>
<p>
As a design strategist, I help organizations make product decisions<br> 
that are human-centered, privacy-minded and grounded in research. 
</p>

    <!---
    </p>
Whether scoping a new idea, learning how a product fits in the<br> 
marketplace, refining an already successful feature, or bringing<br> 
more collaborative work practices to a team, choosing your next steps is<br> 
always easier if you understand the values and motivations of your users. 
  </p>>
<p>
Here are some of the ways that I help teams make quicker, human-centered decisions:
</p>
    <p>
    Design research. 
<!--- <li> Interviews, contextual inquiries, heuristic evaluations,<br> 
  surveys, journey maps, service blueprints, usability tests, and<br>
  design <br>audits are some of the methods that I use to understand <br>
  how individuals and products interact. I perform market and policy research <br>
  to create a broader context for my work. And when possible, I partner with<br> 
  engineers to conduct tech evaluations, particularly when helping organizations</li> 
  manage technology transitions.>
</li>
<li>    
      Workshops. 
      Workshops are great for speeding up decision-making and I love facilitating them.<br> 
  Whether there’s a need to align stakeholders, set a vision, develop a roadmap<br>, or reflect and learn from past work, I’m prepared to structure focused conversations with clear agendas and outcomes.
</li>
    Coaching. 
<li>I help internal teams develop their own ways of gathering insights from users,<br> 
  synthesizing them, and presenting them effectively to leadership. I also help teams </br>
adopt effective ways of communicating, collaborating and reflecting on their work <br> (I’m a certified scrummaster and I’m experienced working on Agile teams).</li>
      
    Compliance strategy. 
<li>With over 5 years leading consulting teams on public sector projects,<br>
I’m experienced working in regulatory environments. Whether it’s FedRAMP, PRA,<br> 
FOIA, the Privacy Act or some other reporting requirement, I know how important it is to<br> 
speed up the burdens of compliance checklists so that there’s time to do the actual work <br>
of keeping data safe and secure.
</li> 
<li>
Collaboration across legal and product teams. 
<li>As a former practicing lawyer, I’m empathetic to the legal teams involved in product development. I’m experienced in bridging communication gaps between designers, engineers and lawyers, enabling better collaboration.
</li>
