      <h1>Nikki Zeichner</h1>
<p>
As a design strategist, I help organizations make product decisions that are human-centered, privacy-minded and grounded in research. 

Whether scoping a new idea, learning how a product fits in the marketplace, refining an already successful feature, or bringing more collaborative work practices to a team, choosing your next steps is always easier if you understand the values and motivations of your users. 

Here are some of the ways that I help teams make quicker, human-centered decisions:
 
</p>
    <p>
    <li>**Design research.** Interviews, contextual inquiries, heuristic evaluations, surveys, journey maps, service blueprints, usability tests, and design audits are some of the methods that I use to understand how individuals and products interact. I perform market and policy research to create a broader context for my work. And when possible, I partner with engineers to conduct tech evaluations, particularly when helping organizations manage technology transitions.
</li>
    <li>**Workshops.** Workshops are great for speeding up decision-making and I love facilitating them. Whether there’s a need to align stakeholders, set a vision, develop a roadmap, or reflect and learn from past work, I’m prepared to structure focused conversations with clear agendas and outcomes.
</li>
    <li>**Coaching.** I I help internal teams develop their own ways of gathering insights from users, synthesizing them, and presenting them effectively to leadership. I also help teams adopt effective ways of communicating, collaborating and reflecting on their work (I’m a certified scrummaster and I’m experienced working on Agile teams).</li>
      
    <li>**Compliance strategy:** With over 5 years leading consulting teams on public sector projects, I’m experienced working in regulatory environments. Whether it’s FedRAMP, PRA, FOIA, the Privacy Act or some other reporting requirement, I know how important it is to speed up the burdens of compliance checklists so that there’s time to do the actual work of keeping data safe and secure.
</li> 
    <li>**Collaboration across legal and product teams:** As a former practicing lawyer, I’m empathetic to the legal teams involved in product development. I’m experienced in bridging communication gaps between designers, engineers and lawyers, enabling better collaboration.
</li>
