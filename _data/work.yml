      Led cross-functional teams on early stage product and service design consulting engagements covering a wide array of topics - from upgrading legacy systems to designing shared services to improving how federal privacy offices protect the public's personal information. I performed design, market, and policy research; I facilitated stakeholder workshops; co-designed and tested prototypes; developed product roadmaps; and coached government teams in applying human centered design practices and agile methods to their work. Used human-centered design methodologies to develop strategies and operational objectives with a focus on user-centered design, iterative/agile methods, transparency, and working in the open.
