Here are some of the things that I do: 
- conduct design and policy research to bring focus, identify opportunities, and mitigate risks
- facilitate workshops to align individuals and groups
- identify product market fit
- prototype to test assumptions 
- coach teams in transitioning toward product management and agile methods
- collaboratively develop roadmaps 


For the past four years I worked as a design and product strategist at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), a digital services agency housed within the federal government. There, I led consulting engagements with a variety of agencies (GSA, USDA's FNS, DOJ, EPA). I also developed internally funded research and development projects related to desiging shared services, streamlining grant reporting, and digitizing privacy compliance practices. During my final six months with 18F, I was part of a team that developed a [PII inventory dashboard](https://cg-9341b8ea-025c-4fe2-aa6c-850edbebc499.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/privacy-dashboard) for GSA's privacy office.

Before working in the federal government, I worked in a similar capacity at the local government level as a Code for America fellow. With CfA, I helped the City of Vallejo gain clarity around how it might use technology to improve communication between residents and its police department.
